<H3>Using the Color scheme</H3>
<p>While designing web pages, computer applications, or house interiors, we need 
to find good color scheme - set of colors producing the best impression. For 
every tint there are colors which it can coexist with, and which it can't. Some 
combinations are uncomfortable, or disturbing - while others are pleasant. </p>
<p>Experienced designers choose colors intuitively, many people can smell which 
colors go together well and which don't. However, finding the good combination 
of colors may be sometimes long and gruelling work. The color theory makes the 
work easier. This tool will find set of colors you can start with, and it may 
facilitate your looking for the optimal color palette. </p>
<p>This application generates color schemes of several types. Every scheme is 
based on one (base) color, which is supplemented with additional colors making 
together the best optical imperssion - using one of the authentic 
algorithms.</p><A name=basecolor></A>
<H3>Selecting the base color</H3>
<p>The base color can be set in several ways. The application works primarily 
with the color wheel, and with colors defined by it - <strong>hue</strong> (the 
angle determining position of the color on the wheel), 
<strong>saturation</strong> (100&nbsp;% is the most saturated color, 0 is a 
shade of gray), and <strong>brightness</strong> (100&nbsp;% is lightest shade, 0 
is black). Warm colors (purple to yellow) and cold colors (yellow-green to 
violet) are marked here as well. </p>
<p>We can choose one of the elemetary colors on the wheel by clicking on its 
circle. Primary colors (red, yellow, blue) correspond to angles 0°, 120°, and 
240°, secondary colors (orange, green, violet) to angles 60°, 180°, and 300°, 
tertiary colors are between them. Smaller circles (multiples of 15°) are 
standing for transitional colors. Clicking on any of these colors, you'll set it 
as the base color. </p>
<p>You can change parameters of the base color (hue, saturation, brightness) in 
the input fields. There is a scale 0-360° inside the color wheel, containing a 
small pointer corresponding to the angle of actual color. Clicking on this scale 
you can change the hue without changing brightness and/or saturation (you have 
to click, you cannot drag the pointer). The angle the cursor points at is shown 
in the browser's status line. Similarly, you can set saturation and/or 
brightness by clicking on the scales beside the color wheel. </p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> This tool <strong>doesn't use the standard 
HSV or HSB model</strong> (the same HSV/HSB values ie. in Photoshop describe 
different colors!). The color wheel used here differs from the RGB spectre used 
on computer screens, it's more in accordance with the classical color theory. 
This is also why some colors (especially shades of blue) make less bright shades 
than the basic colors of the RGB-model. In plus, the RGB-model uses 
red-green-blue as primary colors, but the red-yellow-blue combination is used 
here. This deformation also causes incompatibility in color conversions from 
RGB-values. Therefore, <strong>the RGB input</strong> (eg. the HTML hex values 
like #F854A9) <strong>is not possible.</strong> </p><A name=colorschemes></A>
<H3>Color schemes</H3>
<p>The resulting color set is made by installing the base color into one of the 
color schemes. You can select the scheme from the menu on the right. Several 
schemes allow additional settings, which are displayed below the menu. You can 
choose one of following schemes: </p>
<H4>Monochromatic</H4>
<p><IMG class=imgl height=51 alt="" src="help_files/prev_mono.gif" width=51> 
Monochormatic scheme is based on only one color tint, and uses only variations 
made by changing its saturation and brightness. Black and white colors are 
always added. The result is comfortable for eyes, even when using aggressive 
color. However, it's harder to find accents and highlights.</p>
<p>The application makes only several monochromatic variants of each color. 
You'll be able to make others - more or less saturated, lighter or darker. 
Monochromatic variations are made for each color in other schemes, too. They are 
displayed in the color palette below the color sample.</p>
<H4>Contrast</H4>
<p><IMG class=imgl height=51 alt="" src="help_files/prev_compl.gif" width=51> 
Base color is supplemented with its complemet (color on the opposite side of the 
wheel). One warm and one cold color is always created - we have to consider, 
which one will be dominant, and if the result should look warm, or cold. 
Suitable monochromatic variations of this two colors may be added to the 
scheme.</p>
<H4>"Soft" contrast</H4>
<p><IMG class=imgl height=51 alt="" src="help_files/prev_triad.gif" width=51> 
Base color is supplemented with two colors, placed identically on both sides of 
its complement. Unlike the "sharp" contrast, this scheme is often more 
comfortable for the eyes, it's softer, and has more space for balancing warm and 
cold colors.</p>
<p>Additional input field (will be displayed below the scheme menu) sets the 
distance of these colors from the base color complement. The less the value is, 
the closer the colors are to the contrast color, and are more similar. The best 
value is between 15-30°. Higher values aren't too suitable - except the shift by 
60°, which makes another color scheme, <EM>the triade:</EM></p>
<H4>Triade</H4>
<p>The triade is made by three colors evenly distributed on the thirds of the 
color wheel (by 120 degrees). The triade-schemes are vibrating, full of energy, 
and have large space to make contrasts, accents and to balance warm and cold 
colors. You can make the triade in the "soft contrast" scheme setting the 
distance to 60°.</p>
<H4>"Double-contrast"</H4>
<p><IMG class=imgl height=51 alt="" src="help_files/prev_tetrad.gif" width=51> 
This scheme is made by a pair of colors and their complements. It's based on 
<EM>the tetrade</EM> - the foursome of colors evenly distributed on the fourths 
of the color wheel (by 90 degreees). The tetrade is very aggressive color 
scheme, requiring very good planning and very sensitive approach to relations of 
these colors.</p>
<p>Less distance between two base colors causes less tension in the result. 
However, this scheme is always more "nervous" and "action" than other schemes. 
While working with it, we have to take care especially of relations between one 
color and the complement of its adjacent color - in case of the tetrade (90° 
distance), good feeling and very sensitive approach are necessary.</p>
<H4>Analogic colors</H4>
<p><IMG class=imgl height=51 alt="" src="help_files/prev_analog.gif" width=51> 
This scheme is made by base color and its adjacent colors - two colors 
identically on both sides. It always looks very elegantly and clear, the result 
has less tension and it's uniformly warm, or cold. If a color on the warm-cold 
border is chosen, the color with opposite "temperature" may be used for 
accenting the other two colors.</p>
<p>Additional input field sets the distance of adjacent colors - values between 
15-30° are optimal. You can also add the contrast color, the scheme is then 
supplemented with the complement of the base color. It must be treated only as a 
complement - it adds tension to the palette, and it's too aggressive when 
overused. However, used in details and as accent of main colors, it can be very 
effective and elegant.</p>
<H4>Contradictory colors</H4>
<p>There is no scheme named "contradictory" here - on the contrary, it's a color 
scheme, which can't fit into any rule described above. This scheme may not be 
useless - there may be situations, when we have to create shocking, really 
gaudy, jazzy work. Even in this case this tool may be usefull - if your scheme 
differs from all described models, you've got it: nervous, loud, aggressive set 
of colors. Of course, it cannot be suitable for applications requiring not so 
intensive emotions.</p><A name=colorpalette></A>
<H3>Color palette</H3>
<p>The color palette is displayed below the color sample. First column contains 
main colors (according to the chosen scheme). The other columns contain their 
monochromatic variations (the same in one column). Hex-codes in the table are 
links; clicking on any of them, you'll set new base color.</p>
<p>Checkbox below the color table serves to reduce the palette to "WebColors" 
(216 safe colors for WWW pages). Nevertheless, this conversion changes shades of 
colors, and a well-tuned color scheme may be deformed. Therefore, you'd better 
prefer colors, which differs from their WebColors-equivalents as less as 
possible.</p>
<p>To keep the impression of the color scheme, monochromatic variations 
shouldn't be overused - only black and white are often recommended. If you 
really need other variations, choose just several variants of the base color; 
possibly one or two variants of other (contrast) colors as well. Another 
possibility is to use the same variation of all main colors (eg. the same theme 
in lighter, paler, or darker shades). In general, one application (one WWW page, 
one web site) shouldn't use - besides black and white - more than six colors 
(including all variants). This tool hopefully can help you harmonize them.</p>
